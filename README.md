# ft_containers - School 42

Implementation of several containers from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

- **Vector** - Dynamic array supporting fast random access.
- **Stack** - LIFO data structure built on top of `vector`.
- **Map** - Key-value storage implemented using a custom Red-Black Tree.
- **Set** - Unique key storage using the same Red-Black Tree as `map`.
